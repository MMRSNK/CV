#Projects, Technologies, Genres, Platforms:
#I am excited to work on projects that challenge my technical and creative abilities, particularly in developing immersive 3D/2D games or interactive applications. I enjoy working with Unity and C#, and I’m open to exploring new technologies such as VR/AR, multiplayer frameworks, or AI-driven features. I prefer working on games that involve genres like action-adventure, puzzle, RPG, or interactive storytelling. My preferred platforms are mobile (iOS, Android) and desktop (PC), but I am also interested in exploring consoles and emerging technologies like VR.

#I’d prefer not to focus on projects with repetitive or overly simple mechanics unless there is room for creative input or innovation. I’m less interested in hyper-casual games but would be open to working on them if they present a meaningful technical challenge.

#Expectations of a New Company:
#I expect a company that fosters a collaborative, learning-driven environment where developers have the opportunity to experiment with new ideas and grow professionally. I value a culture that encourages clear communication, transparency, and autonomy in tasks, while still providing support when needed. It’s important for me to be part of a team that values creativity and quality in game development, with a focus on delivering polished and engaging experiences.

#A company that provides opportunities for career growth, whether through mentorship, skill development programs, or exposure to new technologies, is highly desirable. I’m also looking for an organization that respects work-life balance and promotes a healthy work environment.

#Preferred Company Structure:
I prefer a small to medium-sized company or team, where the structure is flexible and communication lines are open and direct. I thrive in environments where each team member has a significant impact on the project, and decisions are made collaboratively. Flat structures or teams with minimal hierarchy appeal to me, as they allow for more creative freedom and agile development processes. However, I am adaptable and open to working in larger organizations if they maintain a dynamic and creative workflow.
